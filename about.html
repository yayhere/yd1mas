            <p>Hi! My name is Yahir Dimas. I am a first-year student majoring in computer science and engineering 
                at the University of California, Los Angeles. I graduated, and was the class valedictorian from 
                Shafter High School in 2022. I was also the school representative and a member of the Student 
                Board Member Advisory Council for the Kern High School District, the largest school district in 
                California. The leadership skills that I demonstrated in this council helped change the lives of 
                future generations of students for the better. This summer I am going to be an intern at Northrop 
                Grumman as a software engineer. Some of my hobbies include running, exercising, playing 
                football, and reading fantasy literature.</p>
